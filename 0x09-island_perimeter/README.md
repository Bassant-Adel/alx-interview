# 0x09. Island Perimeter

## Concepts Needed:

1. 2D Arrays (Matrices):

* Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.
* Understanding how to navigate through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).

2. Conditional Logic:

* Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.

3. Counting Techniques:

* Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the islandâ€™s perimeter.
